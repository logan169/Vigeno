# ViGENO

## Python web application encapsulating Pygeno

This project was done during my internship at IRIC and was discontinued after the end of the internship.

### Description 

Genomic and proteomic projects research generate massive amount of data that’s hard to analyse without software support or coding knowledge. In order to help people getting out informations of interests out of big data set, the aim of my internship was to
programme a graphical interface with a python server that helps biologist filtering out pertinent information quickly and easily.

To do so, I had to learn to work with different technology like Python2/3, javascript, AngularJS, D3.js,Flask, Bootstrap, NoSQL (Arangodb), HTML and css and overcome some challenging situations. This experience helped me develop my coding skills and how to work efficiently to make the JSON feeding D3’s animation. 



In my project, I’m working on an interactive tree having pie chart on each node that represent leaf groups dispersion based on a user choice parameter (see treeExample.html). This could help to quickly answering questions like which peptide/SNP is only present in the sick/control groups.
