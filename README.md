### Description 

Genomic and proteomic projects research generate massive amount of data that’s hard to analyse without software support or coding knowledge. In order to help people getting out informations of interests out of big data set, the aim of my internship was to programme graphical interface and interactive visualization tool that helps biologist filtering out pertinent information quickly and easily in order to help them answering questions like which peptide/SNP is only present in the sick/control groups?
